  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  </center>
  <br>
  <p><em><strong>A Case of the Mondays</strong></em> was founded in 2017 by a group of guys working at a bank that volunteered </p>
  <p>to play a few songs at the annual corporate meeting.</p>
  <p> It went so well, they decided to stay together to make a thing of it!</p>
  <br>
  As the name implies, our focus is on alt rock and pop rock hits from the 90s,
  <p>or as we like to call them.. <em><strong>"Oldies for Millienials"</strong></em></p>
  <br>
  <p>But we have been known to throw a few others in there for fun,</p>
  <p>such as, classic rock or acoustic hits.</p>
  <br>
  <p>So we can't guarantee what you'll hear when you see us,</p>
  <p>but we CAN guarantee you'll have a great time.</p>
